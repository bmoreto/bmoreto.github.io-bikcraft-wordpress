## 🚀 About the Course

The **WordPress as CMS Course** is designed for developers who already know how to build websites using **HTML and CSS**, but want to take the next step — learning how to integrate those static sites into the **WordPress environment**.

A **CMS (Content Management System)** makes it easier for both developers and clients to manage website content.  
It provides a simple interface where anyone can add, edit, or remove text, images, and pages — without touching the code.

WordPress is one of the most popular CMS platforms in the world, powering over **25% of all websites** and more than **50% of those that use a CMS**.
